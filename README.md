# Visualizing-Trending-Youtube-Videos-Statistics

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing YouTube video data to gain insights into trends, engagement metrics, and content performance. The analysis was performed using Python for data processing and visualization, and a Tableau dashboard was built for interactive exploration.

## Objective
The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights from YouTube video data, such as:
- Identifying key factors influencing video popularity.
- Understanding engagement patterns (likes, comments, views).
- Visualizing trends in video performance.
- Providing actionable recommendations for content creators.

## Data Overview
The dataset includes various attributes of YouTube videos, such as:
- video_id: Unique identifier for each video.
- title: Video title.
- channel: Name of the channel.
- views: Total number of views.
- likes: Number of likes received.
- dislikes: Number of dislikes (if available).
- comments: Count of comments.
- category: Video category (e.g., Music, Education, Entertainment).
- publish_date: Date when the video was published.
- duration: Length of the video.

## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
   - Handled missing values and formatted data types.
   - Extracted additional insights such as video length categories.
   
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Used Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore trends.
   - Identified correlations between engagement metrics.
   
3. Visualization & Dashboarding:
   - Created interactive visualizations using Tableau.
   - Built dashboards to analyze top-performing videos, trends, and audience engagement.
